Dearest Isay,

Hiking and running are two of the cheapest hobbies in the world. All you need are shoes and transportationa and you are all set! However, as with any hobby, you can improve your enjoyment by improving your gear. Here comes the problem of limited funds with unlimited wants! 

I want to show you how Dada and I value our money and time (time spent working to earn money) by buying items we want and need. I want to highlight the criteria we used for buying these items. Dada and I both realise that the added function each gear provides (or promise to provide) means an increase in price compared to more generic brands/ items. Is money in your pocket more important to you (to save or buy other things) or is it the added feature?

In time and with practice, you will learn to discern which attributes are more important to you. In the early years of your hobby/ journey, I urge you to think about the following questions:
- are the reviews you are watching/ reading from influencers being paid to promote the product or actual people using it, 
- does it have usual issues/ commonly breaks down?
- can it be used for a variety of scenarios or only a few instances?
- do you have items you own that you can use instead?
- do you have the money?
- do you have a place to store the product?
- if the item breaks, can you afford to buy another one?
- if the item breaks, will it go to the landfill or can it be fixed?
- if you don't like the hobby anymore, will the product go to the landfill?

The things you own end up owning you. 

Once are set on purchasing an item/ brand, look for sales! You don't have to buy it right away, there are sales (usually on long weekends, before or after the season) or look at second hand store/ garage sales. OR you can ask Mom if she has hand-me-downs!

You will notice that Dada and I sometimes bought the same items and sometimes different ones. Dada wants his stuff to last a lifetime (AND HE TAKES CARE OF THEM TO MEET THAT EXPECATTION) irrespective of the price *sometimes* while Mama wants the most function for the lowest price. Sometimes the stuff is competitively priced and we end up buying the same stuff. However, one thing we always agree on is safety. We spend less time pondering about these puchases than others. We know exactly what's importance to us - reliability. Being in the forest, seeing very few people, being close to wildlife, exposing ourselves to difficult terrains, and testing our endurance puts us at a higher risk than the average person. Don't worry though, Dada and I research these trails beforehand, we have eqipped ourselves with the right gear, we keep our fitness levels high to keep up with the demands of the trails, AND we trust each other to gage whether it is safe to continue onto challenging terrains or to turn around and go home.
