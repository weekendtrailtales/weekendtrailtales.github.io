Dearest Isay,

Today, we dropped you off at Auntie's place and Nico at Lola's place. Then, Mama and Daddy drove 2 hours to get to the Garibaldi Lake trailhead. 

2 weeks ago, we luckily found an available reservation for Garibaldi camping. Even more amazing is that we got a pass right at the lake. We tried to book 4 months before the season started but it's so popular that the spots are fully booked right when the website opens. 

Garibaldi Lake is my favourite park - Mama and Daddy got engaged at Panorama Ridge, we signed the final contract for our home at the top of Black Tusk (it was the only place that had a signal to send an email!), the lake, the glacier and the mountains are so beautiful, and the additional challenge of hiking up to get there makes it even more magical.

Mama's pack was about 25lbs. I carried the tent and Dada carried our food. Since it was our first time backpacking, I undoubtedly overpacked. I carried stuff that I did not need and did not use: swimwear (it was too cold to swim when we got there), towel, tent footprint (all campsites had tent pads), flipflops (I brought flimsy ones and the terrain from the tent sites had a lot of roots), foam pads (overkill with the tent pad), coffee mug, lots of extra food, and microspikes (did not need it for the hike to Panorama Ridge). I also brought stuff that I did not use but happy to bring again: bag rain cover, rain jacket, and first aid kit. I also have items I need to upgrade later on: puff jacket (currently very heavy and bulky at 3ish lbs), Walmart tent (we sent our backpacking tent to get repaired after ripping on the first use), sleeping bag (currently 4ish lbs). I just bought the sleeping bag a year ago after Uncle and I had camping at the same time. We both wanted to borrow Lola's sleeping bag. Sadly, I did not have backpacking on the radar yet so I bought a car camping sleeping bag. It's warm and the weight does not bother me YET. I'll use it until then. 

This is our first baby free night after your birth. Daddy and I were joking this is what "fun" is for us - hiking and sleeping in the forest!

We have done the hike multiple times and knew what to expect: the only difference is the heavy backpacks. The switchbacks for the first 6km were the worst. Although my bag was comfortable and distributed the weight evenly, I was struggling with my cardio on the uphill. We are slow hikers (even without the packs) and everyone passed us, even older hikers. I am so proud of those older people - I hope to be still hiking at that age! I knew exactly when the grind was ending though, so that gave me a lot of hope. After the fork in the trail, the terrain started getting more flat and I was able to enjoy the hike more. 

When we finally got to the bridge crossing Rubble Creek, the water across was sligthly flooded. It was the first time we have seen it flooded. We were expecting this as we passed by a student ranger and he mentioned it. He said there was an alternative route that will be an uphill but leads to the campgrounds. We checked it out but it was too narrow for our packs. We ultimately decided to use the usual route as people were still trekking through it. There were some made up rock steps people used to avoid getting wet and one tight squeeze with some trees, but we made it through. 

We got to the campground, and started looking for a site! We never paid attention to the campgrounds before so we did not even know where the entrance to the sites were. There were actually so many sites available - 50 in total, all with tent pads! There were also 4 outhouses, 4 day shelters and 4 bear hangs. We picked Site#5 - it had an amazing view of the mountains and the lake, lots of sunshine, AND there were less bugs. I think. 

We prepared our dinner at the day shelter as it was getting cold. There was a family of 4 in the day shelter and it made me miss you a lot. I wish I get to show Garilbaldi Lake to you next time.  

After dinner, we hid our food (we have a bear vault), hanged our bags, and went to bed. We had a refreshing, delightful, cool and quiet night's sleep. It was amazing. I did wake up in the middle of the night and heard metal clanking. I imagine it was a bear trying to get to the food in the bear hangs. I knew we did not have any food or other attractants in our tent site so I happily went back to sleep. We also have bear spray in the tent. I used to be very scared of bears but I found that once I informed myself about the bear facts and behaviour, it made me understand them more and feel less irrational. This was similar to when I gave birth to you. I was at ease leading into the labour, since I did all the research I could do and I trusted myself and Daddy to make the right decisions if there were unexpected complications. I wish you would go about life's scaries the same way - arm yourself with knowledge and make the irrational rational. 

In the morning, we had breakfast by the lake. It was so surreal to be eating breakfast on the pretiest lake in the world. It was so quiet and serene. There was this fresh pine smell. I can hear chipmunks and birds in the background. It was just lovely. I imagine this is what heaven looks like. 

After breakfast, we got ready to hike to Panorama Ridge. I convinced Daddy that this will be the easiest hike to Panorama Ridge since we are saving 7km from the hike in. Surprise, surprise, it was still a very long hike! Luckily, we beat the crowd and the heat. We got to see the marmots before they started getting scared of the muggles. We saw a family of 4 marmots. The Daddy marmot was just sitting by their burrow and let us watch him go about his day. They are so fluffy and cute! There was also one angry marmot by a bush that kept barking at us. I assume they had babies they were trying to protect. We got out of there quickly to give them peace of mind. 

At the top of Panorama Ridge, we explored other parts of the ridge that we have not seen before. Daddy tried to convince me to slide down the snow to save time. I am scared of heights, so my initial reaction was a big NO. I did give it a thought though. I always struggle going down from the ridge due to gravel and snow. After looking at the "snow slide" from different angles, I saw patches of exposed rock towards the bottom. I decided it was too risky for me. Later on, Daddy said there were people that slid down and hurt themselves becuase of the same exposed portion.

We hiked back to camp and packed our bags. We started our hike down. We were absolutely tired but we were running late on picking you up. We hiked so fast, we passed almost all of the hikers going down. We usually hike down slow because I rolled my ankle going down a mountain before (this same mountain!!). In retrospect, we should not have done that, the trail is narrow and we had big packs. Safety first in the mountains.

We got to the trailhead, drove to Auntie's home and  picked you up. We missed you so much!!! 

(We got Nico the next day. We were sooooo tired.)


Love,
Mama
