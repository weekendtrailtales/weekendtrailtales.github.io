My sweet, little Isay,

Early August, we left the house at 5am to cross the US border. The plan is to hike the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail - right next to Mt. Baker! We heard about the great views on this hike and have high expectations. We left you at Lola's house. It was Nico's first time crossing the border! The road up Mt. Baker Highway was steep, windy and a lot of portions were by the edge of the cliff. Now, I know why this road gets closed often when it snows. The drive from our house to the trailhead was about 2 hours. 

At the trailhead, we soaked in the view of the sourrounding mountains: Mount Shuksan, Cascade Mountain Ranges and Mount Baker. The first 2 km of our hike was by the side of Table Mountain; We had an unobstracted view of unending mountain ranges. Chain Lakes Trail was flat and exposed to the sun. I imagine Lolo and Lola are able do this part of the trail. It seemed like nature has taken over: like this part of the world has been untouched by man's efforts to modernization. It was easy to look at the bottom of the mountain and activate my fear of heights, SCARY! As always, I just take it 1 small, secure step at a time. I trust myself.

We turned left at the fork. If you turn right, it continues to the Chain Lakes where there are campground by Mazama Lake, Iceberg Lake, Hayes Lake, and Arbuthnet Lake. Perhaps, next time we can camp there! 

The rest of the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail was the same: flat, by the edge of the mountain, had amazing views, and exposed to the sun. About 7km in to the hike, we saw people setting up campgrounds by Coleman Pinnacle and some were hiking onto a big blue lake. We thought this was another great campground site; fairly flat, easy hike. We continued on, put on our microspikes and passed by snow patches. We started seeing wild flowers! Lots of purple, red, yellow! It started gradually getting uphill. We reached Camp Kisser, another campground. The campgrounds were flat and people set up wind breaks for thier camp using rocks. There were a lot of volcanic rocks. The steep uphill started. After the long hike, the last 1km with a 40% gradient incline was TOUGH. There were gravel, big rocks, and ice. It was hard. Finally, we were at the ridge! We had an amazing view of Mt. Baker and a 360 degree view of the park.   

We had lunch and started our long trek down. All of our tiredness was instantly gone with the views again. Oh how the mind plays with you (in a beatiful way)!!

Overall, this was an AMAZING hike. It is a popular hike and now we know the reason. Spectacular views from start to finish of the hike!

11 hours later, we are back at the border and on our way to pick you up!


Love, 
Mama
