Dearest Isay,

We went on our 1st family vacation! We decided to go to Hawaii since it is only a 5 hour flight from Vancouver! We stayed at Papa's old work, The Prince Hotel, right at Waikiki beach! This is super awesome beacuse Mama is still on maternity leave and we are on a budget! We always travel on budget though, something that you will eventually get used to.

We planned for a 7 day vacation (+ 1 travel day). There were a lot of things to do in Oahu, Hawaii! I researched a lot and looked for child-friendly options. I wanted to explore nature - I was very excited being surrounded by mountains and the ocean! Dada has been to Hawaii before, so he did not mind not going to the famous touristy spots. The perfect day for us would have been to hike in the morning and go to the beach in the afternoon. Here's our itinerary:
Day 1:  Flight arrives at 7pm

        Wiliwilinui Ridge Trail
        Waikiki Beach

Day 4:  Area: North Shore

Day 1

We had an easy flight to Hawaii. We picked the last row of the plane - we were thinking IF you cried, it would be less embarassing for us since no one else is behind us. Surprise, surprise! You did not cry in the flight! Mama made sure to give you lots of milk during the flight take off and touch down. 

There were also a lot of babies and young kids in the flight. There was a baby right in front of us and you kept each other entertained. 

We picked up the car rental at the airport and arrived at the hotel at around 11pm. That was a long day!

Day 2

We got up early and drove to Wiliwilinui Ridge Trail. The trailhead is inside a gated community. We signed in at the guards station and they gave us a parking pass. It rained a little bit in the beginning of our hike and it was muddy. We were prepared with rain jackets and sturdy shoes so we contined on. They had very different fauna in Hawaii. The different smells of the plants, flowers and fruits, the humidity, and the sounds of insects and birds, were all very new to us and made for an interesting hike. 

The first 1.5km of the hike was easy and had moderate incline. The stairs started thereafter and we reached the ridge of the mountain. There were little shrubs and trees on each side of the ridge so it was not that scary for Mama. We got to a viewpoint and ate our packed lunch. 

When I saw the rest of the hike and realised it was going to be very STEEP, I decided not to continue. It was too risky for me: carrying you, the mud, the steepness of the incline, the rain, and the humidity were beyond my comfort zone. Dada wanted to keep going. You and I stayed at the lunch spot and waited for him. An hour later, he came back! He said it was good we didn't come because thethe rest of the hike had vertical inclines, scrambling and ropes that would not have been safe or easy for us. He also said he did not see the view at the top. Boooo! He wanted to wait for 15 mins for the fog to pass but he knew I would have been worried if he took so long, so he hurried back to us. 

Hindsight is always 20/20. I urge you to push yourself and test your limits. Along the way, you will learn to know yourself and trust the decisions you make in life. 

After the hike, we went back to the hotel, rested for a little bit and explored Waikiki beach!

Day 3

We went to Hanauma Bay to snorkel! It is on a cove that protects the coral reefs from the strong waves of the sea. The park did a really nice job - balancing protecting the environment and allowing visitors in to enjoy the park. When we entered the park, we watched a quick video about Hanauma Bay's history, the park's management and rehabilitation program, and what visitors can and cannot do in the park to minimise the damage to the corals. 

When we got the beach, we looked for a spot that had a shade. We ended up under/ inside a short palm tree! It was funny! Mama and Dada took turns going in the water. Dada explored far into the ocean while I stayed by the shore. Dada saw different kinds of fish and I saw little baby ones! The park closed at 3pm and we headed to our next adventure. 

We saw Leonard's Bakery food truck on the street and just we had to try malesadas. We had freshly made donuts sprinkled with sugar. Yum! Yum! 

Shortly, we arrived at the trailhead of Koko Crater at around 5pm. It was still very hot and humid. I tried to delay hiking up by eating more malesadas :D 

The trail is an abandoned railroad that used to transport supplies back in World War 2. The hike up was brutal - exposed to the sun, the weather was hot and humid, continous incline with no breaks in between, the uneven railroad steps. All that plus we spent the day lounging on the beach!

We reached the top at sunset! We had a 360 view of the SE side of the island. We were surrounded by mountain ranges and unendless ocean! It was amazing.

Day 4

Today, we went to Ma'akua Ridge Trail loop. We parked by the beach and started our hike, clockwise. Thankfully, this hike was covered by trees and had easy elevation inclines. There was a fruit bearing tree all over the place that gave the trail a sweet, delicous smell. It reminds of an apple or makopa. The hike was on the side of the mountain and had some views of the ocean on the eastern side of the mountain. The trail was marked and you can clearly see the footpath by previous hikers. At one point, we got lost. We started going around fallen trees and needing to make our own path. We checked the map and backtracked. On the western side of the mountain, we had a view of Hauula Forest Reserve.
