Dearest Isay,

We went on our 1st family vacation! We decided to go to Hawaii since it is only a 5 hour flight from Vancouver! We stayed at Papa's old work, The Prince Hotel, right at Waikiki beach! This is super awesome beacuse Mama is still on maternity leave and we are on a budget! We always travel on budget though, something that you will eventually get used to.

We planned for a 7 day vacation (+ 1 travel day). There were a lot of things to do in Oahu, Hawaii! I researched a lot and looked for child-friendly options. I wanted to explore nature - I was very excited being surrounded by mountains and the ocean! Dada has been to Hawaii before, so he did not mind not going to the famous touristy spots. The perfect day for us would have been to hike in the morning and go to the beach in the afternoon. Here's our itinerary:

Day 1

We had an easy flight to Hawaii. We picked the last row of the plane - we were thinking IF you cried, it would be less embarassing for us since no one else is behind us. Surprise, surprise! You did not cry in the flight! Mama made sure to give you lots of milk during the flight take off and touch down. 

There were also a lot of babies and young kids in the flight. There was a baby right in front of us and you kept each other entertained. 

We picked up the car rental at the airport and arrived at the hotel at around 11pm. That was a long day!

Day 2

We got up early and drove to Wiliwilinui Ridge Trail. The trailhead is inside a gated community. We signed in at the guards station and they gave us a parking pass. It rained a little bit in the beginning of our hike and it was muddy. We were prepared with rain jackets and sturdy shoes so we contined on. They had very different fauna in Hawaii. The different smells of the plants, flowers and fruits, the humidity, and the sounds of insects and birds, were all very new to us and made for an interesting hike. 

The first 1.5km of the hike was easy and had moderate incline. The stairs started thereafter and we reached the ridge of the mountain. There were little shrubs and trees on each side of the ridge so it was not that scary for Mama. We got to a viewpoint and ate our packed lunch. 

When I saw the rest of the hike and realised it was going to be very STEEP, I decided not to continue. It was too risky for me: carrying you, the mud, the steepness of the incline, the rain, and the humidity were beyond my comfort zone. Dada wanted to keep going. You and I stayed at the lunch spot and waited for him. An hour later, he came back! He said it was good we didn't come because thethe rest of the hike had vertical inclines, scrambling and ropes that would not have been safe or easy for us. He also said he did not see the view at the top. Boooo! He wanted to wait for 15 mins for the fog to pass but he knew I would have been worried if he took so long, so he hurried back to us. 

Hindsight is always 20/20. I urge you to push yourself and test your limits. Along the way, you will learn to know yourself and trust the decisions you make in life. 

After the hike, we went back to the hotel, rested for a little bit and explored Waikiki beach!

Day 3

We went to Hanauma Bay to snorkel! It is on a cove that protects the coral reefs from the strong waves of the sea. The park did a really nice job - balancing protecting the environment and allowing visitors in to enjoy the park. When we entered the park, we watched a quick video about Hanauma Bay's history, the park's management and rehabilitation program, and what visitors can and cannot do in the park to minimise the damage to the corals. 

When we got the beach, we looked for a spot that had a shade. We ended up under/ inside a short palm tree! It was funny! Mama and Dada took turns going in the water. Dada explored far into the ocean while I stayed by the shore. Dada saw different kinds of fish and I saw little baby ones! The park closed at 3pm and we headed to our next adventure. 

We saw Leonard's Bakery food truck on the street and just we had to try malesadas. We had freshly made donuts sprinkled with sugar. Yum! Yum! 

Shortly, we arrived at the trailhead of Koko Crater at around 5pm. It was still very hot and humid. I tried to delay hiking up by eating more malesadas :D 

The trail is an abandoned railroad that used to transport supplies back in World War 2. The hike up was brutal - exposed to the sun, the weather was hot and humid, continous incline with no breaks in between, the uneven railroad steps. All that plus we spent the day lounging on the beach!

We reached the top at sunset! We had a 360 view of the SE side of the island. We were surrounded by mountain ranges and unendless ocean! It was amazing.

Day 4

Today, we went to Ma'akua Ridge Trail loop. We parked by the beach and started our hike, clockwise. This hike was covered by trees and had easy elevation inclines. There was a fruit bearing tree at the start of the hike that gave a sweet, delicous smell. It was a circular, red fruit, similar to an apple or a makopa. The hike was on the side of the mountain and had eastern side had views of the ocean. The trail was clearly marked and you can  see the footpath by previous hikers. We started going around fallen trees and needed to make our own path. At this point, we suspected we were lost. We checked the map and backtracked. We had lunch at a little creek. When we continued our hike on the western side of the mountain, we had a view of lush mountains of Hauula Forest Reserve. 

Next stop was Haleiwa Town. We joined the line up at Matsumoto Shave Ice. It was one of the few touristy things we did on this trip :D

We drove West to Ka'ena Point. It was long road and we did not see a lot of cars or houses asfter Haleiwa. We did a hort hike by the rocky shore. We didn't see any wildlife but whales and seals are sometimes spotted here. We were, however, still very happy to be watching the sunset by the amazing coastline and felt so close to nature.  

Day 5

We set on to the hardest hike of our trip, the Kuli'ou'ou Ridge Trail. I don't remember much about the hike but I do remember a lot of stairs. From the viewpoint at the peak, we can see Hanauma Bay, Koko Crater and Diamond Head. It was very windy at the top. I had to make sure I was holding on to all of our stuff or they were gonna get blown away into the mountains. I also had to cover your eyes because of the loose gravel! 

We rested for a bit in the hotel and headed to Waikiki beach. We all went to the water. Daddy and I saw a big turtle swimming near the beach. You loved playing with the water and the gentle waves crashing onto your belly. Daddy and I looked at the beautiful sunset for A VERY QUICK 5 SECONDS and when we looked back at you, you managed to grab a seaweed and put it in your mouth. SO FAST! You are such a funny little girl. We were laughing the entire time. 

Day 6

We had an easy day and did a short hike to Ehukai Pill Box. This used to be an old World War 2 bunker with views of the North Shore. We explored the rest of the trail and was suprised to find a bamboo forest, a moutain biking trail, and big boulders. 

We contined on to Shark's Cove to snorkel. Unlike Hanauma Bay, the entrance to the water was a little sketchy and rocky. It also had a lot more people since it was free, unlike Hanauma Bay that had a fee and needed a reservation. I saw so many fish here! I did not go far and still I saw different kinds of fish. I even saw a big school fish. I swam with them for a good 15 minutes (from a far) until a litte girl got too close and spooked them away. I wish you, Daddy and I were all watching them together. Meanwhile, you were napping with Daddy by the shore. When you woke up, Daddy and I switched turns and he went to swim. He agreed there were more fish here than Hanauma Bay. He swam super far again. Learning that sharks come here sometimes, thus the name, did not deter him!

Day 7

This day was our touristy, laid back day. We went to Iolani Palace in the morning. We learned about the Kingdom of Hawaii, their last queen and her imprissonment. In the afternoon, we went to Diamond Head. The hike had an easy incline but the heat and the crowd line-ups made it hard. At the top, we saw the inside of the volcanic cone, explored more bunkers, learned it was used as a military lookout back in World War 2,  and saw the view of Waikiki Beach. 

Day 8

We packed our bags, checked out of the hotel, and loaded the car. Every morning when we would load our car, we wondered what other people thought of us; We had dirty clothes (we did not pack that much clothes!), muddy shoes, hiking poles, lots of water and A BABY! While all other hotel guests had flowery vacation mode clothes! It's funny but at the end of the day, Daddy and I did not care. This is the lifestyle we chose and it makes us happy! Hopefully, you find the beauty in nature, the joy of climbing mountains, and the strength in challenging yourself to go places most people won't. 

We went to a luau - we watched dancers, singers, and drummers perform, we watched them roast a pig, we joined activities like peeling a coconut and braiding coconut leaves, and we were gifted leis. All while eating delicious lunch! We continued for a stroll at Waimea Valley. They had different kinds of plants and flowers, but lots of mosquitoes! At the end of the stroll, we saw Waimea Falls. 

We had a long day, and we still had to fly home. We slept on the flight back. We got home at around 7am PST. Mom and Dad were so tired. We decided to take the train and it eneded up taking about 2 hours to get home. We are taking a cab next time!! We slept the rest of the day when we got home. 

We were so tired but so so happy to get to spend 1 week fully present with each other and got to explore a beautiful place.
